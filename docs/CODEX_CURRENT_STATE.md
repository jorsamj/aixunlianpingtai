Run `34733035739` passed syntax, all permanent owner guards, all frontend unit tests and Real Chrome runtime regressions after ZIP 10k owner/manifest migration. Browser navigation runs **33 tests and passed 33/33**. Permanent Action Fencing workflow `34733035761` is green; permanent Resource Discovery SQLite workflow `34700900542` remains green on Ubuntu and Windows. Do not merge `main`, bump `VERSION.txt`, tag or release without explicit user approval.

## Product closure — Plain image upload whole-task progress truth CLOSED

The final live ordinary-image upload owner is the storage61 `doUploadImages426` path posting to `/api/projects/{project_id}/images`. The endpoint is synchronous HTTP, but after browser request bytes are sent the server still performs temporary-file handling, image validation, selected-storage object write, SHA256 calculation and material record commit. Therefore browser `xhr.upload` byte completion is not whole-task completion.

Closed semantics:

```text
browser byte transfer: 0% -> 85%
byte transfer complete: hold at 85%, show “文件已上传，正在服务器入库”
server-side synchronous commit: no fabricated percentage animation
successful HTTP completion after material commit: 100%, show “服务器入库完成”
network/non-2xx failure: never claims terminal 100%
```

This batch deliberately does **not** invent a durable background task, fake queue, or fake server progress for a synchronous endpoint. Terminal 100% is fenced to the authoritative successful HTTP completion. Permanent behavior guard: `tests/frontend/image-upload-overall-progress.test.mjs`; Release Regression includes that test in its permanent path scope.

```

The one-shot product migration workflow was removed in the product commit. No merge to `main`, tag, release, A800 RC, or genuine 10k ZIP acceptance was performed.

## Product closure — AI annotation polling queue metadata truth CLOSED

The durable v60 AI annotation backend/public projection already exposes real `resource_queue_position` and `resource_wait_reason`, and `annotationTaskView()` already turns that truth into `runtimeText`. Initial page rendering consumed `runtimeText`, but `AutoLabelPollRuntime` used a separate row renderer during polling refresh and omitted it. Result: a task could initially show `资源队列第 N 位` / resource wait reason and then lose that truthful metadata after the first managed poll refresh even though durable truth had not changed.

Closed semantics:

```text
initial render: durable status + progress + runtimeText
managed polling refresh: the same durable status + progress + runtimeText
QUEUED / WAITING_RESOURCE: resource queue position remains visible after every refresh
resource wait reason: remains visible when projected by annotationTaskView
no frontend queue simulation, no claim/order/resource-fencing changes
```

The fix is intentionally narrow: `static/modules/auto-label-poll-runtime.js` now renders existing `view.runtimeText` beside the status pill. No backend queue ordering, task claim, execution fencing, polling cadence, or progress semantics changed. Permanent behavior guard lives in `tests/frontend/auto-label-poll-runtime.test.mjs`; Release Regression path scope now includes both the polling runtime and its guard.

No merge to `main`, tag, release, A800 RC, or genuine 10k ZIP acceptance was performed.

## 2. Current priority

```text
TECH-DEBT CLEANUP PAUSED BY USER REQUEST
→ PRODUCT MAINLINE: Deployment Artifact E2E CLOSED
→ Unified Task Progress Phase 1 + Phase 2 CLOSED
→ Training Progress v2 CLOSED
→ ZIP 10k import scalability CLOSED (live v19 + cold candidate manifest)
→ ZIP Processing P2c COCO/VOC structured single-write CLOSED
→ Plain image upload whole-task progress truth CLOSED
→ AI annotation polling queue metadata truth CLOSED
→ NEXT: horizontal queue-position/progress truth audit across video, cleaning, storage import and deployment test
→ genuine 10,000-image processing acceptance remains DEFERRED by explicit user instruction
→ SSE/event stream evaluation DEFERRED
→ non-blocking Navigation Action Fencing final scan remains DEFERRED
→ Resource Lifecycle production soak / non-SQLite resource classes
→ backend regression / A800 RC only when explicitly resumed
```

A800 RC remains deferred unless the next product/acceptance task explicitly resumes it.

### 当前产品主线 — ZIP 10k import scalability CLOSED

Technical-debt cleanup remains paused by user request. Product productionization is the active line.

- **Deployment Artifact E2E CLOSED** — successful conversion jobs surface only verified, existing deployment artifacts. Product `b75b7d09780f691b01e4207c3107977b0500d8aa`, focused run `34726749756`, cleanup `8f3d3e394ceed73e5f522cba512622286fead7a5`.
- **Unified Task Truth API Phase 1 CLOSED** — `/api/v62/projects/{project_id}/tasks` remains the durable public truth for queue/resource/worker/progress metadata. Product `aa5b82ebd2140d3a9f03dc6ae6754c9b7a55afcc`, focused run `34727100684`, cleanup `6de0758e9f0c0cd45d79c48bf7fb022dde8f9ca6`.
- **Unified Task Progress Phase 2 CLOSED** — model conversion, AI annotation and cleaning/material-batch business surfaces expose durable waiting-resource/queue/worker/progress truth without parallel polling owners. Products `9817f450b3fbd20256279c3c861b0938ffdcef16` and `ff31f879b6d501a501188fed8bc78426d9eb31ea`.
- **SSE/event stream evaluation DEFERRED** — current page-scoped polling remains lifecycle-managed; no EventSource/replay/reconnect base is introduced without demonstrated need.
- **Training Progress v2 CLOSED** — existing `training-metrics.sqlite3` persists truthful latest-epoch duration, rolling ETA, throughput, losses, trainer metrics/mAP when supplied, LR and elapsed time; Worker mirrors the compact snapshot into `job.json` without extra list requests. Product `70110f9668e593215bc77c8614dd9d6dd55b7601`, focused run `34730431744`.
- **ZIP 10k import scalability CLOSED — hot-state/candidate split + live v19 owner**: baseline proved the final v36 visible ZIP action still delegated to synchronous `doImportData()` / `/api/v18/.../import`, and a synthetic 10,000-candidate v19 `job.json` was **1,370,177 bytes**. The product now routes final v36 ZIP upload through existing v19 background jobs and stores the full candidate manifest once in `scan-images.json`; hot `job.json`, running list polling and detail polling no longer carry the 10k candidate array. Create response is bounded to 500 candidates for the picker; selecting-job list preview is bounded to 300; running/terminal task state stays O(1) in candidate count. Selected-path validation reads the cold manifest. Product `b4875ada5ff084fd4e21d7c5f026f5b09128033b`, focused run `34731027723`, cleanup `e819a35c71f6aa20f7739281ddfc75e8502104ce`.
