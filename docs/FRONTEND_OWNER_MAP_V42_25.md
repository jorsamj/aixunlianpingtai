# Frontend Final-Owner Map — v42.25

## 1. Purpose

This map exists to delete historical frontend overrides without changing current behavior. Preserve live semantics, not version-era wrapper count. `static/app.js` remains a historical append-only chain; later assignments can completely shadow earlier layers or individual branches.

## 2. Runtime ownership

```text
static/app.js bounded classic render/page shell
→ static/main.mjs
   → PageRequestScope
   → PollRegistry
   → NavigationStability
   → named runtimes
```

Navigation ownership is already outside the classic `setPage` family. Current cleanup target is the remaining render/post-render chain and lifecycle debt.

## 3. Closed owner batches

### Navigation / polling

```text
training/job polling compatibility              CLOSED
set423Base + setBase424                         CLOSED
V37 duplicate sidebar setPage                   CLOSED
oldSetV39 + oldSet42 + set422Base               CLOSED
v34/v35/v42.4 direct setPage family             CLOSED
v42.7 direct alias setPage                      CLOSED
setPageReady414                                 CLOSED
baseSetPage417                                  CLOSED
initial bootstrap setPage                       CLOSED
```

`static/app.js` contains zero classic `window.setPage=` assignments.

### Render / lifecycle

| Batch | Physically retired | Accepted code / run |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | v42.7 render-level auto-label alias mutation | `e35a29b0...` / `34656747269` |
| R2 | `oldRender429` | `0455eeef...` / `34659041402` |
| R3 | `previousRender61` | `69732d9e...` / `34659543452` |
| R4 | `render423Base` | `58ece59e...` / `34659775870` |
| R5 | shadowed `renderBase428` 算法列表 branch | `6be679b6...` / `34660269685` |
| R6 | v42.2 + v42.4 legacy `自动标注` render route branches | `66339fc0...` / `34663089996` |
| R7 | shadowed `renderBase424` 算法列表 / 数据集 / 训练任务 branches | `2d9bc0b3...` / `34663389819` |
| R8 | legacy `renderAutoLabel424` old-page 1.8s self-refresh timer/predicate | `70b6f755...` / `34663768606` |
| R9 | visible-version multi-owner chain: `baseRender417`, 12 app timers, main `applyBuildVersion` timers | `36fd25c4...` / `34664755130` |

R9 product commit: `1e9ae1118a77313d8dd3d4c0cf12d5ce5f9edff7`. Final acceptance increased the browser suite to 15 tests; **15/15 passed**. All one-shot migration helpers/workflows were removed after success.

## 4. Current final navigation owner

```text
window.setPage = NavigationStability.stableSetPage
  → normalizeNavigationPage
  → PageRequestScope / epoch
  → PollRegistry.beforeNavigate
  → waitForNavigationReady
  → beforeInvokeNavigation
  → performNavigation(page)
       state.page = page
       render()
  → PageRequestScope.alignPage
  → PollRegistry.afterNavigate
  → persistNavigationState
```

Historical localStorage `自动标注` values canonicalize to `自动标注及清洗` before render and are written back canonically.

## 5. Current visible owner map

| Surface | Current live owner | Required semantics | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| Navigation coordination | `NavigationStability` | request epoch, readiness, sidebar cleanup, actual apply, persistence | unit + Real Chrome |
| Training submit | `TrainingSubmitRuntime` | sole `/train/start`, canonical draft/readiness | unit + Chrome |
| Training jobs request | `TrainingTaskRuntime` | focused `/jobs`, coalescing, force-fresh mutation | unit + browser performance |
| Training jobs timer | `PollRegistry(training-jobs)` + `renderTraining423` activation | managed cadence + navigation cleanup | unit + Chrome |
| AutoLabel route | `renderBase427 → renderOps427()` | canonical `自动标注及清洗` | unit + Chrome |
| AutoLabel polling | `AutoLabelPollRuntime + PollRegistry` | explicit activate/deactivate | unit + Chrome |
| Video | `PollRegistry(video-frames)` | managed one-shot row patch | unit + Chrome |
| Sources | `PollRegistry(sources)` | managed interval | unit + Chrome |
| Data/material route | `oldRender412 → renderDatasets424()` | stable outer data route | unit + browser performance |
| Algorithm list route | `oldRender412 → renderAlgorithms423()` | sole outer algorithm route | browser performance + guard |
| Training task page route | `renderBase428 → renderTraining423()` | training-only route | browser performance + guard |
| Quality center route | `renderBase424 → renderQualityCenter424()` | live route retained | guard |
| Video slicing route | `renderBase424 → renderVideo424()` | live route retained | guard |
| Deployment routes | `oldRenderV39` | conversion/artifact/resource/plugin/component | liveness audit |
| Label management route | `render414Base` | label management | liveness audit |
| Storage configuration route | `finalRender` | `renderStorageSources61()` | dedicated Chrome contract |
| Visible top version | `top412 / V412` | formal `v42.24.0` | unit + Chrome |
| Visible sidebar version | `nav426 / V426` | formal `v42.24.0` | unit + Chrome |
| Internal UI build metadata | `UI_BUILD_VERSION` → `document.documentElement.dataset.uiBuild` | `42.25.0-dev`, non-visible | unit guard |

## 6. Version ownership after R9

The failed baseline proved visible version had multiple asynchronous owners:

```text
50d72687f099eb554ec77e9045e42713025c4453 / run 34664100285
frontend PASS
Chrome 14 PASS + 1 FAIL
received v42.25.0-dev after expecting formal v42.24.0
```

Retired:

```text
baseRender417 render correction wrapper
baseRender417 120/600/1600ms correction timers
12 app.js delayed versionBadge startup timers
main.mjs applyBuildVersion()
main.mjs 80/500/1800/3600/8000ms visible version writes
```

Retained semantic owners:

```text
static/index.html initial visible badge → v42.24.0
top412 / V412                         → top badge v42.24.0
nav426 / V426                         → sidebar footer v42.24.0
UI_BUILD_VERSION                      → internal dataset metadata only
```

This is locked by `tests/frontend/version-marker-owner.test.mjs` and the 15th navigation Real Chrome contract.

## 7. Render topology — confirmed live / retired

### Confirmed live

```text
oldRender412      算法列表 / 数据集
renderBase428     训练任务
renderTraining423 current training renderer + PollRegistry activation
renderBase427     自动标注及清洗
renderBase424     质量中心 / 视频切帧
oldRenderV39      deployment routes
render414Base     标签管理 route
finalRender       素材存储配置
```

### Physically retired

```text
oldRender429
previousRender61
render423Base
renderBase428 算法列表 branch
v42.2/v42.4 legacy 自动标注 route branches
renderBase424 算法列表 / 数据集 / 训练任务 branches
renderAutoLabel424 legacy old-page timer/predicate
baseRender417 visible-version wrapper/timers
historical visible-version delayed writers
```

## 8. Remaining render audit targets

Independent liveness proof is still required for:

```text
baseRenderV37
  requestAnimationFrame page enhancement

render426base
  post-render file-input beautification

post-render cleanup wrapper + MutationObserver
older base/global render generations still reachable through delegates
```

`oldRenderV39`, `render414Base`, `renderBase424`, `renderBase427`, `renderBase428`, `oldRender412`, and `finalRender` are confirmed live and are not whole-wrapper deletion candidates without semantic migration proof.

## 9. Permanent proof currently active

Frontend:

```text
tests/frontend/retired-sidebar-setpage-guard.test.mjs
tests/frontend/retired-pre-v424-setpage-guard.test.mjs
tests/frontend/render-alias-restore.test.mjs
tests/frontend/render-owner-retirement.test.mjs
tests/frontend/version-marker-owner.test.mjs
tests/frontend/navigation-stability.test.mjs
tests/frontend/auto-label-poll-runtime.test.mjs
```

Browser suite includes:

```text
tests/browser/navigation-stability.spec.mjs
tests/browser/navigation-readiness.spec.mjs
tests/browser/auto-label-polling.spec.mjs
tests/browser/algorithm-list-performance.spec.mjs
tests/browser/training-task-performance.spec.mjs
tests/browser/material-pagination-performance.spec.mjs
```

Current accepted Real Chrome suite: **15/15** in run `34664755130`.

## 10. Per-batch checklist

```text
live HEAD
→ exact reference/liveness/source-order proof
→ deterministic regression or browser contract
→ bounded physical deletion
→ permanent guard
→ syntax/focused unit
→ full frontend
→ Real Chrome
→ delete temporary migration artifacts
→ sync all four handoff docs
```

## 11. Release boundary

No `main` merge, `VERSION.txt` bump, tag/release or A800 acceptance claim is authorized. A800 RC remains deferred until current P0/P1 debt and zero-point scan are complete.
